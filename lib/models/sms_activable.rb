    # SmsActivable is responsible to verify if an account is already confirmed to
    # sign in, and to send sms with confirmation instructions.
    # Confirmation instructions are sent to the user phone after creating a
    # record and when manually requested by a new confirmation instruction request.
    #
    # == Options
    #
    # Confirmable adds the following options to devise_for:
    #
    #   * +sms_confirm_within+: the time you want to allow the user to access his account
    #     before confirming it. After this period, the user access is denied. You can
    #     use this to let your user access some features of your application without
    #     confirming the account, but blocking it after a certain period (ie 7 days).
    #     By default confirm_within is 0 days, so the user must confirm before entering.
    #     If you want to allow user to use parts of the site and block others override 
    #     sms_confirmation_required? and check manually on selected pages using the
    #     require_sms_activated! helper or sms_confirmed? property on record
    #
    # == Examples
    #
    #   User.find(1).sms_confirm!      # returns true unless it's already confirmed
    #   User.find(1).sms_confirmed?    # true/false
    #   User.find(1).send_sms_token # manually send token
